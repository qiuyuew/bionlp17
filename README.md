# Requirements

* python 2.7 (should work with 3.6 but not tested)
* bash terminal

# Setup
* Uncompress data folder: `tar -zxvf data.tar.gz`
* Create a python virtual environment: `virtualenv env`
* Activate virtual environment: `. env/bin/activate`
* Install python modules: `pip install -r python_modules.txt`

# Run experiments

This is optional as all the result files are already included in this repo. Run the experiments if you want to regenerate them.

First activate the virtual environment: `. env/bin/activate`

## Baseline and all the heuristics
`sh script/single_instance.sh`

## Multi-instance learning baseline
`sh script/multi_instance.sh`

# Obtain results

Figures are stored in eval/figures

## Compute scores in Table 5
`python src/compute_scores.py`

## Draw Figure 2
`python src/draw_scores.py`

## Draw Figure 3
`python src/draw_curves.py`
